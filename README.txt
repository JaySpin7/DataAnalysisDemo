## Program Details ##

This is a basic program that will allow you to enter 5 different numerical values, then will calculate some basic (but still
potentially useful) bits of data based on those 5 values. These include an average increase, largest increase, and smallest increase.
The "ID" part of the latter two represents the number of increases that have happened at the time that data was calculated (including that
increase itself). For example the increase between values 1 and 2 would have an ID of 1, while the increase between 4 and 5 would
have an ID of 4. The "value" part of these is self explanitory: Just the value of the increase itself. This program also comes with built-in
error handling, just in case an invalid input is made at any point in the session.

## Disclaimer ##

This program is a demo. While I am able to create software that actually has real world value, that is not what this one is for.
This program is strictly intended to serve as a way for me to showcase my skills as a software developer. Due to the fact how I am self-taught,
I am not able to provide any credentials/certifications that would need to be obtained from a third party, so I hope you will
accept this instead.
